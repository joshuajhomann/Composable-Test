# Composable-Test

This is a demo project for the 6 June 2020 Flock of Swifts meetup which shows how to:

1) create a master-detail flow in the Composable Architecture
2) Use `IdentifiedArrayOf` to get the uniquely identified item from a selection
3) Pass optional substate to the detail view using `IfLetStore
4) Composition of reducers using `combine` and `pullback`
5) Mutation of substate
6) using the `debug` higher order reducer
